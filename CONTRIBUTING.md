If you have ideas, suggestions, problems or encountered a bug, please let me know, preferably by filing an [issue](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/FTLAV/issues) at this GitHub repository.

If you want to delve into the code you will probably need some knowledge of [Processing](http://processing.github.io/processing-javadocs/core/index.html) (Java library responsible for the rendering of the graph) or/and Java (UI, data-parsing and basically everything else). For the Java part you can look at [Vhati](https://github.com/Vhati)â€™s version of [FTL Profile Editor](https://github.com/Vhati/ftl-profile-editor), of which a large part of the code of this project is based. Use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html) to compile the source code.
