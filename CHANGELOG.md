# FTLAV 3.1.0

- NEW: Added markers in visualisation that show hazards and other information. These include: Store (S), Red Giant (RG), Pulsar (P), Asteroid Field (AF), Anti-Ship Battery (ASB), Rebel Fleet (RF) and Hostile Ship (HS). Addresses issue [#6](https://github.com/Niels-NTG/FTLAV/issues/6).
- NEW: Create a recording when the player arrives at the beacon and whenever the event type changes, allowing the recording of both the start and end of an encounter at the same beacon.
- NEW: Enable hull strength in the visualiser by default.
- NEW: Record the ID number of each beacon.
- FIX: Set minimum size for visualiser window.
- FIX: Save game parsing is now much more reliable.
- FIX: Create only 1 release, not one for Mac/Linux and one for Windows, since there was no difference between these.
